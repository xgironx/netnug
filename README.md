This is the source code repository for the Visualization and Animation Network Environment (VANE). VANE is an investment project as a part of MASON, with a goal of producing a web-based network modeling and visualization tool that can be used as a light-weight supplement to RiverBed's [SteelCentral NetPlanner](http://www.riverbed.com/products/steelcentral/network-performance-management/steelcentral-netplanner.html) (formerly OPNET NetPlanner).

For more documentation on project structure and usage, check out the [docs](docs) folder.

To jump right in with an example network, look at the network files in the [examples](examples) folder.

For the source code, look in the [vane](vane) folder.
